The red vertices seem to form a set that covers all the edges of the graph, indicating a solution to the vertex cover problem. The vertex cover problem is a classical optimization problem where the goal is to find the smallest set of vertices such that every edge in the graph is incident to at least one vertex in the set. The graph itself has a pentagonal structure on the outer edges, with an additional five vertices inside the pentagon that are fully interconnected, forming a complete graph K5 (every vertex inside the pentagon is connected to every other vertex inside).

Star Oil may purchase any fraction of each investment, in which case, the cash outflows and NPV are adjusted proportionally. For example, if Star Oil purchases one-fifth of investment 3, then a cash outflow of (1/5)*5=1 million dollars or $1 million would be required at time 0, and a cash outflow of (1/5)*5=1 million dollars or $1 million would be required at time 1. The one-fifth share of investment 3 would yield an NPV of (1/5)*16=3.2 million dollars or $3.2 million. Star Oil wants to maximize the NPV that can be obtained by investing in investments 1-5. The goal is to formulate an LP that will help achieve this objective. Assume that any funds left over at time 0 cannot be used at time 1. Find the maximum NPV in million dollars.", "Answer": "57.449", "Category": "optimization", "Type": "complex_lp"}
{"id": 211, "Question": "Semicond is a small electronics company that manufactures tape recorders and radios. The per-unit labor costs for tape recorders and radios are $50 and $35 respectively, and the raw material costs are $30 for tape recorders and $40 for radios. The selling prices are $100 for a tape recorder and $90 for a radio, as outlined in Table 10. On December 1, 2002, Semicond has enough raw material to manufacture 100 tape recorders and 100 radios. On the same date, the company\u2019s balance sheet shows cash at $10,000, accounts receivable at $3,000, and inventory outstanding valued at $7,000, with a bank loan liability of $10,000, resulting in a current ratio of 2 ($20,000 in total assets over $10,000 in liabilities), as shown in Table 11. Semicond must decide how many tape recorders and radios to produce during December, considering that demand is high enough to sell all units produced. Although all sales in December will be on credit, with payment not received until February 1, 2003, Semicond will collect $2,000 in accounts receivable in December. Furthermore, Semicond has to pay off $1,000 of its loan and a monthly rent of $1,000 in December. On January 1, 2003, Semicond will receive raw materials worth $2,000, to be paid for on February 1, 2003. Management has mandated a minimum cash balance of $4,000 for January 1, 2003. Additionally, to satisfy bank requirements, the current ratio on January 1 must be at least 2. Find the maximal contribution to profit from December\u2019s production in $.", "Answer": "2500", "Category": "optimization", "Type": "complex_lp"}
